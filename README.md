# Project Euler

Another place for me to practice solving problems and training my Rust skill.

## Requirement:

- Rustc >= 1.58

## Usage:

```
cargo run --release --bin prob<id>

<id>: problem's id
```
#### Note: 

The id of problem according to problem's id on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress)

For example: 

- `cargo run --release --bin prob1` to see solution for problem 1
- `cargo run --release --bin prob2` to see solution for problem 2
