# Project Euler

Another place for me to practice solving problems and training my Rust skill.

## Requirement:

- Rustc >= 1.58

## Usage:

### Run main solution for problem

```bash
cargo euler prob<id>

<id>: problem's id
```

### Run test for problem

```bash
cargo euler_test prob<id>

<id>: problem's id
```

### Note:

The id of problem according to problem's id on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress)

For example:

- `cargo euler prob1` to see solution for problem 1
- `cargo euler prob2` to see solution for problem 2
- `cargo euler_test prob5` to see test for problem 5
